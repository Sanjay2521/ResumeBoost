# ðŸŽ¤ ResumeBoost Pitch Script - Amazon Q Codathon

## **OPENING (2 minutes)**

"Good morning, judges! I'm [Your Name], and I'm here to solve a crisis that affects millions of job seekers worldwide.

**[PAUSE FOR IMPACT]**

Here's a shocking statistic: 85% of resumes are rejected by ATS systems before they ever reach human recruiters. That means 85% of qualified candidates are eliminated not because they lack skills, but because they don't know how to optimize their resumes.

But the problem goes deeper. Even if you pass the ATS filter, you still need to:
- Ace the interview with personalized preparation
- Prove your technical skills through coding assessments  
- Continuously learn and upskill for career growth

Today, these are all separate, expensive, and fragmented solutions. 

**[TRANSITION]**

That's why we built ResumeBoost - the world's first complete AI-powered career acceleration ecosystem."

## **LIVE DEMO (5 minutes)**

"Now, let me show you ResumeBoost in action. I'm going to walk through the complete user journey that transforms a struggling job seeker into an interview-ready professional.

**[DEMO STEP 1: Resume Upload - 30 seconds]**

First, I'll upload a sample resume... **[UPLOAD FILE]** 

And instantly, our AI analyzes it and gives us an ATS score of 78 out of 100. Look at these personalized recommendations - it's telling us exactly what to improve: add more technical keywords, quantify achievements, and optimize the format.

**[DEMO STEP 2: AI Interview - 1 minute]**

Now, based on this specific resume, our AI has generated personalized interview questions. **[CLICK AI INTERVIEW]**

See how it's asking about React and Node.js because those were mentioned in the resume? This isn't generic - it's tailored to this candidate's background. The AI provides real-time feedback on answers and tracks performance metrics.

**[DEMO STEP 3: Technical Assessment - 1 minute]**

Next, let's test technical skills. **[CLICK TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT]**

Here are 20 comprehensive coding questions. I can write code in multiple languages - Python, JavaScript, Java, C++. Watch this - I'll solve a quick algorithm problem... **[TYPE CODE]** 

The code executes in real-time, and I get instant feedback on correctness and performance.

**[DEMO STEP 4: Learning Roadmaps - 1 minute]**

For continuous learning, we have 9 specialized tracks. **[CLICK ROADMAPS]**

Each track has over 100 carefully curated problems from top platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks. Users can track their progress and filter by difficulty.

**[DEMO STEP 5: Hardware Specialization - 1.5 minutes]**

Here's what makes us truly unique - our hardware engineering focus. **[CLICK EMBEDDED ROADMAP]**

We have comprehensive tracks for embedded systems covering C programming, microcontrollers, RTOS, and hardware interfacing.

And here's our crown jewel - **[CLICK VERILOG COMPILER]**

A fully functional Verilog compiler that not only compiles your code but generates RTL diagrams and timing analysis. This is industry-first functionality that no other platform offers.

**[PAUSE FOR IMPACT]**

From resume upload to job-ready professional - all in one platform."
